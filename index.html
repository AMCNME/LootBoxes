            <p style="font-weight: bold;">The UK government is set to publish a White Paper to tighten regulations against the 
            £700m loot box industry, a third of which is spent by underage gamers, but campaigners fear it’s too little 
            too late as the gaming industry jumps ship to new gambling mechanics.</p>
            <p>Hassan Hadif thinks he spent close to a thousand pounds trying to win virtual items in video games as a teenager, 
            having become addicted after he realised these items can be traded to others for real money.</p>
            <p>“The rarest items in the games go for upwards of £1,000 on marketplaces and the idea of claiming an item of that 
            value to my young mind was baffling,” the 20-year-old said.</p>
            <p class="quote">“But it turns out I’ve spent hundreds nearing a thousand 
                on this game and ended up with nothing of any particular rarity or value.”</p>
            <p>What Hassan was buying was called a loot box – a virtual slot machine that offers players the chance to win items 
            including weapons, costumes and ingame currency. A few loot boxes can be opened for free, but those with better odds at 
            winning higher valued items usually require additional purchases. </p>
            <p>Loot boxes, which are estimated to be worth £700m, just over 10% of the UK's almost £6bn video game market, are not 
            regulated under the current gambling laws. The Gambling Commission, which regulates UK gambling does not consider this part 
            of its remit because items in loot boxes cannot be cashed out for real money. But researchers and parents are calling for 
            something to be done to regulate these mechanics. </p>

            <p>Matthew Bloch, a York-based software engineer was alerted to loot boxes when his nine-year-old son was playing on Roblox, an online game platform. He was worried at the lack of checks and regulation, compared to more traditional forms of gambling.</p>
            <p class="quote">“You can go into a bookie on a high street, pay with your credit card and play on their roulette wheel. That’s so heavily regulated. But that’s happening in Roblox with six or seven year-olds,” he said.</p>
            <p>“You can’t win any money with Roblox, but for a child, whose excitement of an afternoon is staked on it, it’s the same buzz. It can get to the same level of desperation because I saw it in my son.”</p>

            <p>The gaming industry has long used various methods of monetisation. Traditionally, this has been in the form of a one-off purchase, a subscription or free games, supplemented with advertising revenue. Since the rise of mobile games in the early 2010s, which are mainly free to play, the industry’s has shifted toward ‘microtransactions’. These encourage users to purchase in-game items such as loot boxes using real money.
            Although most games don’t allow players to cash out loot box rewards, there are online marketplaces where they can buy and sell loot box items for real money. </p>

                <p>Following <a href="https://www.begambleaware.org/sites/default/files/2021-03/Gaming_and_Gambling_Report_Final.pdf">research</a> that suggested links between loot boxes and gambling, the government launched a call for evidence on loot boxes in September, 2020, as part of a wider review of legislation. Following repeated delays, a White Paper setting out proposed next steps is expected to be published in the coming months.</p>
                <p>But campaigners fear any reforms will be too little too late, as the gaming industry has already moved on to developing new mechanics.</p>
                <p>“Even if it’s legislated against, it’s still not going to be going far enough” said Marc Skinner, of the charity Addiction Recovery Agency.</p>
                <p>“Loot boxes are one element but there are other things online that lawmakers need to protect people from. But they haven’t, they just dragged their heels.” </p>
                <p>He pointed to skin betting, which involves using cosmetic in-game items such as "skins", as virtual currency to bet on the outcome of professional matches.</p>
                <p>EA, the makers of FIFA and Star Wars Battlefront which both feature loot boxes, previously said that loot boxes aren't akin to gambling but are instead "surprise mechanics” similar to Kinder Eggs.</p>
                <p>They are one of the largest video game publishers in the world, and have faced significant consumer backlash over their use of loot box mechanics.</p>
                <p>Appearing before the Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport Committee in 2019, Kerry Hopkins, the company’s vice president of legal and government affairs, said: “We think it's like many other products that people enjoy in a healthy way, and like the element of surprise.”</p>
                <P>EA declined to comment.</P>

                <p>A 2021 report by Juniper Research suggests that the amount of money generated by loot boxes will continue to grow but at a much lower rate compared to previous years. There is also evidence to suggest models such as subscriptions or battle passes are becoming more popular.</p>
                <p>Battle passes let players unlock rewards for completing in-game challenges. Games usually offer some free passes but players can also pay for premium passes annually or seasonally for enhanced items.                </p>
                <p>Adam Wears, research analyst at the market research company, said: “In recent years, publishers and developers have pivoted towards subscriptions and battle passes, recurring sources of revenue that provide long-term returns on investment, as opposed to traditional, one-off purchases of downloadable content or, indeed, loot boxes.”</p>
                <p>He expects the government to set out measures to restrict the use of loot boxes in video games in the upcoming gambling law review.</p>
                <p>This could include listing prices in real-world currencies, capping how many loot boxes a player can buy over a certain period of time, and displaying the odds of winning high-quality loot boxes.</p>
                <p>Legal experts in the gaming industry however believe a complete ban on loot boxes is unlikely.</p>
                <p>“I think the hope is that if there’s any sort of regulation coming up, it’ll be consumer- orientated,” said Isabel Davies, video games and digital entertainment solicitor at Wiggin, “but having gone from saying they are not a regulated gambling product to banning it completely seems pretty severe.”</p>
